      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>"In software, there's no shortage of chefs, don't hire one for the title, hire one for the taste."</p>
      <p>"Creating software is like building a house. Its layers built on top of layers, but without a good foundation... you'll need a new home again REAL soon."</p>
      <p>"Bitcoin is the Gangsta Rap of the tech world."</p>

      <h3>Wisdom</h3>
      <p>"Unless you're all-knowing, you're ignorant of something. Humility isn't weakness, it's awareness."</p>
      <p>"Respect your first impression, but never trust it fully. Perception is a process, not a passing glance."</p>
      
      <h3>Business Craft</h3>
      <p>"Knowing your audience sells the story. Knowing your user shapes the experience. Marketing speaks; UX listens. Don't confuse the two."</p>
      <p>"Product design is truly an art guided by science, NOT the other way around."</p>
      <p>"It's called a 'road-map' because you can always draw a path, but you'll need a map to get back to it."</p>
      
      <h3>Rhymes</h3>
      <p>“If you think innovation is measured in market price, think twice.. utility always precedes the roll of speculative dice.”</p>
      <p>“From crypto to AI to metaverses… when no solution makes sense Rito Rhymes is at your service.”</p>
      <p>"I'm the IBM of Rap, no cap, code cracked... Rito's rhymes are key, cryptically... no math"</p>
