          Rito was intrigued. He felt the resonance of William's vision for the ERC—the way it could ripple outward and rewire the landscape.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          He had just finished a <em>Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction</em> and did what most broke, idealistic graduates do: became an infotaining rapper in Web3 while juggling a long-shot software startup. He knew the harsh realities of NFT marketplaces, where everyone thought they were the next digital Picasso and no one wanted to buy art unless it came with a token-gated Discord and a roadmap to nowhere.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Curious to see if anything could actually be set in motion, he started searching. The usual suspects—platforms he’d used, the clear go-to’s, the obvious contenders for pioneering something new.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          In an industry oversaturated with scams and high-friction fantasies—where someone proposes a “game-changing revolution” every five seconds, usually in all caps—it wasn’t easy to get a decision-maker to stop, listen, and actually take a proposal seriously. But with a blockchain legend like William attached, maybe—maybe—there was enough gravity to cut through the noise. If Rito could just find the right context.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          He dug. LinkedIn profiles, governance docs, Twitter threads, forum posts, half-dead Discords, and a graveyard of broken hyperlinks. He didn’t know what he was looking for, exactly—just a loose end to pull.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Rarible made sense.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          They were early adopters of <em>ERC-721</em>. OGs. Still active. Still influential. If anyone could legitimize the rollout of a new standard, they could.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          But when Rito looked past the frontend—past the artists, the drops, the UI he’d clicked through so many times—he found something he hadn’t fully seen before:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <em>The Rarible Protocol.</em>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          A modular, open-source backend used by thousands of projects—from niche collectives to giants like Mattel and Ubisoft. Not just a marketplace, but infrastructure. An entire ecosystem humming beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          And it didn’t stand alone.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          It was governed by the <em>Rari Foundation</em>, a separate nonprofit entity stewarding a DAO made up of <em>$RARI</em> token holders. Governance discussions happened in Discord. Funding required on-chain voting. And no one seemed to agree on who, exactly, had the final say. The lines between Rarible, the Foundation, and the DAO were unclear—by design or by entropy.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          And somewhere inside that fog, Rito saw it: this wouldn’t be a handoff. It would be a campaign.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The ERC wouldn’t be adopted by a single person or platform. It would need to be shepherded. Sold. Fought for.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          If it was going to happen, someone would have to:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          – Write the proposal and pitch it.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          – Rally the DAO.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          – Navigate the Foundation’s politics.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          – Convince Rarible leadership to lend support.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          – And somehow spark a chain reaction from within the protocol to the broader NFT ecosystem.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          It wasn’t a roadmap just yet. It was a vision. And visions are expensive—paid in time, uncertainty, and belief.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          So the question hung in the air:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          What would it cost Rito and what would it be worth?
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          On one hand, he was a broke NFT artist trying to forge a Web3 career out of equal parts dream and delusion. On the other, he was standing at the edge of something rare—
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          A road that might lead to becoming as immortal as the blockchain itself.
