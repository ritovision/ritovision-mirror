        <h2 className={styles.innerHeading}>Overview</h2>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The brand repositioning initiative for William Entriken was architected as a foundational ecosystem build rather than a one-time marketing campaign. Recognizing the lack of an active influence or outreach strategy at the time, the project focused on future-proofing William’s public-facing identity — creating a platform that could seamlessly integrate his existing social contributions, publications, and presence without requiring immediate behavioral change.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Instead of attempting to overhaul William’s authentic voice across platforms like Twitter/X or GitHub, the strategy worked backwards from the reality of his current trajectory, designing a foundational website that could unify and contextualize these activities into a coherent, accessible public identity.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Thematic Identity and Positioning</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          A critical strategic choice was to center William’s new identity around the mantle of Civic Hacker. This title — while formally recognized by governments and authorities — remains relatively obscure in the mainstream, offering a rare opportunity: William could own and define a new archetype for broader audiences, positioning himself at the forefront of a role that aligns naturally with his multifaceted expertise.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The Civic Hacker identity was selected because it bridges William’s activities across cybersecurity, open-source contributions, blockchain infrastructure, and civic tech — all domains he has materially impacted. It also frames his authorship of foundational standards like ERC-721 in a broader, more socially resonant context — replacing narrow “NFT guy” perceptions with a leadership narrative rooted in governance, public good, and innovation.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          To ground this identity and avoid appearing rogue or informal, business leadership elements were woven directly into the brand positioning. William’s experience as a financial analyst, corporate consultant, and enterprise manager reinforced the Civic Hacker archetype with corporate legitimacy — framing him not as a rebellious outsider, but as a recognized contributor operating alongside major institutions and industries.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Ultimately, the new brand frames William as a multifaceted Civic Hacker Businessman — aligning him with the rare echelon of pioneers who have catalyzed multi-billion dollar industries, while carefully distinguishing him from traditional tech billionaires whose trajectories involve company ownership and direct financial stakes.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Content Strategy</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Shifting William’s identity away from being solely “the NFT guy” did not mean minimizing his contribution to the NFT ecosystem. On the contrary, the strategy called for amplifying his impact — creating a deep, accessible narrative that lays out the seminality of his work in clear, authoritative terms.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The home page itself — titled Legacy — functions as a tribute to William’s foundational role in decentralized technologies. Rather than assuming deep technical knowledge, the content was designed to introduce mainstream and non-technical audiences to the significance of standards like ERC-721 and ERC-165 through plain English and narrative storytelling.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The site balances high-level overviews with optional deep dives, allowing visitors to choose their level of engagement. Where phor.net assumes technical fluency, WilliamEntriken.net acts as a thematic archive, a cornerstone asset structured for press, partners, collaborators, and general audiences to understand his authority and legacy at a glance.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Importantly, the site is designed to stand on its own — long-lived and evergreen — while also serving as a flexible foundation for future campaign-driven shifts, should William or future marketing teams choose to run targeted outreach or re-engagement strategies. Wix was deliberately chosen as the platform for its ease of maintenance and modular content management, ensuring scalability without technical friction.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Audience Strategy</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The brand strategy acknowledges multiple overlapping audience needs.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.audienceHeading}>Mainstream Non-Technical Audiences</h3>
        <p className={styles.audienceText}>
          Introduce the Civic Hacker identity and William’s pioneering contributions in accessible, digestible terms.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.audienceHeading}>Technical Audiences and Industry Insiders</h3>
        <p className={styles.audienceText}>
          Provide a structured overview of William’s ecosystem impact, with the option for deeper exploration through references to standards, technical work, and open-source contributions.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.audienceHeading}>Press and Media</h3>
        <p className={styles.audienceText}>
          Offer a clean, authoritative resource to support accurate coverage and positioning — through an expanded Press Kit, clear biographical framing, and accessible achievement timelines.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.audienceHeading}>Potential Collaborators and Clients</h3>
        <p className={styles.audienceText}>
          Signal corporate seriousness and technical credibility, while maintaining the accessible, human dimensions of William’s brand.
        </p>

        <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Summary</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          The William Entriken brand strategy and implementation initiative created a foundational ecosystem — not just a website. It repositioned William from a narrowly recognized technical figure into a multidimensional Civic Hacker Businessman, aligning him with the rare class of industry pioneers who have catalyzed billion-dollar ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          By centering on authenticity, future-proof structure, and audience accessibility, the project built the infrastructure for William’s long-term thought leadership, public engagement, and potential future campaigns — while fully respecting the organic authenticity that defines his ongoing public presence today.
